# Experimental Data Analysis

**Course Description:**

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of experimental data analysis, incorporating industry-standard tools like R, SQL, and Tableau. Students will learn how to effectively collect, organize, visualize, and interpret data from scientific experiments, leveraging statistical methods, error analysis, and computational tools. The course will also emphasize the integration of AI assistance for enhanced data exploration and analysis.

**Course Objectives:**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the fundamental principles of experimental design and data collection.
* Apply appropriate statistical methods for analyzing experimental data using R.
* Perform error analysis and quantify uncertainties in measurements.
* Utilize data visualization techniques in Tableau and Python to effectively communicate results.
* Employ SQL for data querying and management.
* Leverage AI assistance (e.g., code generation, data insights) for data processing and analysis.
* Interpret and draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data.
* Write clear and concise reports summarizing experimental findings.

**Target Audience:**

Undergraduate or graduate students in science, engineering, data science, or related fields.
